Go Render It
======================

When creating a website mock up, one of the most tedious tasks is to create place holder images. The original spec says 250x250 so you create an image - then it changes to 150x150, or the colour changes, so you then have to open the image editor and this takes time -- too much time!

Go Render It is a service that renders images for your mock ups, all parameterised and can be modified with ease.
