Go Render It
======================

When creating a website mock up one of the most tedious tasks to place holder images. The original spec says 250x250 so create an image, then it changes to 150x150 or the colour changes. Then have to open the image editor and this takes time, too much time!

Go render is a service that renders images for your mock ups, all parameterised and can modified with ease.
